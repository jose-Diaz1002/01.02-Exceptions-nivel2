01.02-Exceptions-Nivel2

This Java project demonstrates how to validate user input for different data types, such as `byte`, `int`, `float`,
`double`, `char`, `String`, and `boolean`. It ensures that the user enters valid data and handles exceptions gracefully.

Features
- **Input Validation**: The program validates user input for various data types and handles incorrect formats.
- **Error Handling**: It uses `try-catch` blocks to manage exceptions and provides user-friendly error messages.
- **Interactive Prompts**: The program prompts the user for input and continues until valid data is entered.

Technologies Used
- **Java**: The project is written in Java and uses the `Scanner` class for user input.
- **Exception Handling**: Custom exceptions and built-in exceptions like `InputMismatchException` are used to handle invalid input.

How to Use

Follow the Prompts:
The program will ask you to enter different types of data (e.g., age, ID number, height, etc.).
Enter the requested data, and the program will validate it.

Requirements
